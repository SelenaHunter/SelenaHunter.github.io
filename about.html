		<h1>About</h1>
		<h2 class="subtitle">Growth and comfort do not coexist.</h2>
		<p>I've been an artist and designer for years, but I like the challenge of building. I like JavaScript, a lot. (It reminds me of happy days spent programming Flash games in ActionScript, okay?) I also like React, a lot. (Don't judge me.) I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow and become a better developer.</p>
		<h2 class=subtitle>Strong Opinions, Loosely Held.</h2>
		<p>I'm a firm believer in cooperating with and understanding your fellow human beings. My goal is to make the world a more accepting place, one page at a time. The internet needs more accessibility, including support for people with disabilities, as well as gender-neutral language for people who might not fit into typical boxes.</p>
		<h2 class=subtitle>Curiosity, confidence, courage, and constancy.</h2>
		<p> I'm proud to be a queer female developer. My pronouns are she/her, but they/theirs or even he/his is fine too. Whatever's easiest.</p>
		<p>I like video games more than TV or movies. If the TV is on, it'll be the Disney Channel. I listen to ridiculous playlists made for my favorite characters while I'm working. If I'm not coding or learning, I'm probably drawing and writing with my SO and furry, four-legged baby.</p>
