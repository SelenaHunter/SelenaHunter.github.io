		<h1>Internship</h1>
		<p>From August to December 2019 I was the sole web developer and designer for <a href="safeharborim.com/">Safe Harbor International Ministries</a>, a non-profit organization based in Georgia, whose mission is to assist families and children who have experienced domestic violence.</p>

			<h2>Duties</h2>
			<h3>Web Design (HTML, CSS):</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A full redesign of the entire website was performed using the Divi theme along with custom CSS.</li>
				<li>I was in constant collaboration with the director, social media team, and administration team to create a consistent, modern look that better reflected the target audience.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Accessibility:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I lead a site-wide accessibility effort to bring each page up to WCAG standards to the greatest degree possible.</li>
				<li>Semantic HTML was instituted on every page, which involved re-writing most existing HTML by hand.</li>
				<li>All font colors were checked against WCAG standards and changed for better readability and compliance.</li>
				<li>Font sizes were increased and mobile view was overhauled for ease of readability.</li>
				<li>Carefully-selected alt text was created and added to every image on the website.</li>
				<li>All pages were audited both by hand and using Lighthouse.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SEO:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I initiated a site-wide SEO overhaul, a project to be carried on and completed by other interns.</li>
				<li>I increased Safe Harbor's SEO ranking for several search engine terms.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Site Maintenance and Future Volunteers:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I created two style guide manuals - a large document with detailed stylistic instructions for future Web Design and Development team interns and volunteers, and a lighter document with basic essentials for the Blogging team.</li>
				<li>Each of these documents provides detailed step by step instructions for stylistic considerations, font sizes, color selection, SEO, alt text, and more.</li>
				<li>I created several video walkthroughs and training videos as a part of these manuals.</li>
				<li>All of these will be used to teach future interns and Safe Harbor volunteers, helping them to easily keep the site's design consistent and accessible for years to come.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>This role was graded by the director of Safe Harbor. Out of 106 possible points (including extra credit), I received 106 – the maximum score. References from the director are available upon request.</p>
